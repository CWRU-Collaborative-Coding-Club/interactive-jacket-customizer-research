# Week 1: Project Setup & Basic Interface

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for Week 1 of the Interactive Jacket Customizer Research project. The focus this week is on setting up the development environment and creating the basic application interface.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Set up a React project with TypeScript

**Resources:**
- [GitHub Branch Protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)
- [GitHub Project Boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)

**Expected Output:**
- A properly configured GitHub repository
- A clear branching strategy
- Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests

#### 3. Install Core Dependencies

**Tasks:**
- [x] Install React and ReactDOM
- [x] Install TypeScript
- [x] Install dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
- [x] Install @react-spectrum/color for color picker
- [x] Install Zustand for state management
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier

**Resources:**
- [dnd-kit Documentation](https://docs.dndkit.com/)
- [React Spectrum Color](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/ColorSlider.html)
- [Zustand Documentation](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)

**Expected Output:**
- All necessary dependencies installed
- Package.json with proper dependencies
- Initial configuration for all libraries

#### 4. Set up Basic Flask Server Environment

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create Python virtual environment
- [x] Install Flask and required dependencies
- [x] Set up basic API endpoints
- [x] Configure CORS for cross-origin requests
- [ ] Create basic server tests

**Resources:**
- [Flask Quickstart](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)
- [Flask-CORS Documentation](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/)

**Expected Output:**
- A working Flask server with basic endpoints
- Proper CORS configuration
- Environment setup with virtual environment

### Days 3-5: Basic Application Shell

#### 1. Create Layout Components

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement AppLayout component
- [x] Create ThreeColumnLayout for main interface
- [x] Design sidebar containers
- [x] Set up responsive grid layout
- [ ] Implement basic styling with SCSS

**Expected Output:**
- Basic application layout structure
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Styled sidebars and main content area

#### 2. Create Static Jacket Visualization

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create JacketCanvas component
- [x] Add placeholder jacket images
- [x] Implement front/back view toggle
- [ ] Set up canvas overlay for draggable items
- [ ] Create basic styling for the jacket display

**Expected Output:**
- Jacket canvas with front and back views
- Working view toggle button
- Placeholder for draggable items

#### 3. Set up Zustand Store for State Management

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create basic app state store
- [x] Implement view state (front/back)
- [x] Create placeholders for item state
- [ ] Set up store for user information
- [ ] Create initial history tracking for undo/redo

**Resources:**
- [Zustand Tutorial](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)

**Expected Output:**
- Functioning state management for basic app state
- State persistence between component renders
- Foundation for more complex state management

## Checkpoints and Milestones

### Checkpoint 1 (End of Day 2)
- Working React application that builds without errors
- Flask server that runs and responds to basic requests
- GitHub repository set up with correct branching structure

### Checkpoint 2 (End of Day 4)
- Basic layout components implemented
- Zustand store set up with initial state
- Jacket canvas with view toggle functionality

### Final Milestone (End of Week 1)
- Complete application shell with all components in place
- Responsive layout that works on different devices
- State management for basic application features
- Proper folder structure and code organization

## Common Issues and Solutions

### React with TypeScript
- **Issue:** TypeScript errors with React components
- **Solution:** Use proper type definitions for props and state

### Flask CORS
- **Issue:** CORS errors when connecting React to Flask
- **Solution:** Ensure Flask-CORS is properly configured

### Zustand Store
- **Issue:** Components not updating when state changes
- **Solution:** Make sure components are properly subscribing to state changes

## Evaluation Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated based on:

1. **Functionality:** Does the application meet the requirements?
2. **Code Quality:** Is the code well-organized, documented, and maintainable?
3. **User Experience:** Is the interface responsive and intuitive?
4. **Technical Implementation:** Are the libraries used effectively?

## Team Collaboration Tips

1. **Task Division:** Divide tasks based on components or features
2. **Code Reviews:** Review each other's code before merging
3. **Communication:** Use GitHub Discussions for design decisions
4. **Documentation:** Document your code and decision-making process

## Next Week Preview

In Week 2, we'll focus on implementing the core drag-and-drop functionality, creating draggable items, and setting up the drop target on the jacket canvas.
