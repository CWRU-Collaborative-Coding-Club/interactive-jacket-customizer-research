# Jacket Images

This directory is where the jacket images need to be placed. For the application to function properly, you'll need to create and add the following files:

- `jacket-front.png` - Front view of the jacket
- `jacket-back.png` - Back view of the jacket

## Image Requirements

1. **Resolution**: The images should be at least 800x1000 pixels for good quality display
2. **Format**: PNG format with transparency to allow for proper item placement
3. **Styling**: The jacket should be photographed or rendered against a transparent background
4. **Consistency**: The front and back views should be consistent in size, lighting, and style

## Creating Jacket Images

As a student developer, you have several options to create these images:

1. **Photography**: Take photos of an actual jacket and remove the background
2. **Digital Design**: Use Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or other design tools to create a vector illustration
3. **3D Rendering**: Use Blender or other 3D software to create a realistic render
4. **AI Tools**: Use AI image generation tools to create jacket designs (with proper licensing)

## Placeholder Approach

If you're not ready to create final images, you can use simple placeholders:

1. Create a basic outline of a jacket in your preferred design tool
2. Export front and back views as PNG with transparent backgrounds
3. Place them in this directory with the correct filenames

The application will load these images as the base canvas for customization.

## Copyright Considerations

Ensure that any images you use:

1. Are created by you or the team
2. Are properly licensed for use in this research project
3. Do not contain copyrighted designs or logos without permission

## Image Processing

For the best results:

1. Optimize the images for web (compress without losing quality)
2. Ensure the jacket is centered in the frame
3. Make sure front and back views are aligned and of consistent size
4. Test with various screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior
