# Development Log - Interactive Jacket Customizer Research

This file documents the daily development progress for the Interactive Jacket Customizer Research platform. The log follows the implementation plan outlined in the project documentation.

## Week 1: Project Setup & Basic Interface

### Day 1 (2025-02-27)
**Tasks Completed:**
- Created repository structure and initialized React project
- Set up GitHub repository with README and LICENSE
- Installed core dependencies:
  - React 18
  - dnd-kit/core
  - dnd-kit/sortable
  - @react-spectrum/color
  - zustand
- Created initial project documentation
- Set up development environment

**Challenges:**
- Had to resolve version compatibility issues between React 18 and some dependencies
- Researched best approach for jacket canvas implementation
- Had to find libraries and tech stacks for the project setup

**Hours Worked:** 5


## Week 2: Divide into three teams & set each team lead
Current Approach is close to an agile methodoloy with parallel development

### Day 2 (2025-02-28)
**Tasks Completed:**
- Created basic application layout with CSS Grid
- Implemented sidebar containers for drag sources and customization panel
- Set up Zustand store with initial state structure
- Created central jacket canvas component
- Added static placeholder for jacket visualization
- Set up component folder structure

**Code Highlights:**
- Created responsive layout that maintains proportions across screen sizes
- Implemented first Zustand store slice for managing view state (front/back)

**Hours Worked:** 7

### Day 3 (2025-03-01)
**Tasks Completed:**
- Implemented front/back jacket view toggle functionality
- Created basic drag source components for sidebar
- Set up canvas drop areas with position calculation
- Added initial state management for placed items
- Set up GitHub Actions for basic CI checks

**Key Decisions:**
- Decided to use SVG for jacket components rather than HTML elements for better scaling
- Implemented state persistence between front/back views

**Challenges:**
- Had to resolve positioning issues when calculating drop coordinates

**Hours Worked:** 8

## Week 2: Core Drag-and-Drop Functionality

### Day 1 (2025-03-04)
**Tasks Completed:**
- Implemented drag sensors using dnd-kit
- Created draggable item components for all item types
- Added visual feedback during drag operations
- Set up drop validation logic

**Technical Details:**
- Used dnd-kit's useDraggable and useDroppable hooks
- Implemented custom drag overlay for preview
- Added animation for drag start/end

**Next Steps:**
- Implement drop handling with accurate position calculation 
- Add item selection mechanism

**Hours Worked:** 6

---

### Day 2 (2025-03-05)
**Tasks Completed:**
- Implemented drop handling with position calculation
- Created Zustand actions for adding and updating items
- Added item selection functionality
- Implemented delete capability for placed items

**Challenges:**
- Had to implement custom position calculation to account for jacket scaling
- Resolved state update issues when switching between views

**Hours Worked:** 7
